rad=deg * math.pi /180 
deg=rad*180/pi

Python includes two functions in the math package; radians converts degrees to radians, 
and degrees converts radians to degrees

Note that all of the trig functions convert between an angle and the ratio of two sides of a triangle.
cos, sin, and tan take an angle in radians as input and return the ratio; 
acos, asin, and atan take a ratio as input and return an angle in radians.
You only convert the angles, never the ratios.

You can simply convert your radian result to degree by using
math.degrees and rounding appropriately to the required decimal places
for example

>>> round(math.degrees(math.asin(0.5)),2)
30.0
