45° Slopes in a Tile based 2D platformer

those formulas are similar to : " the law of similar triangles "

From what I understand reading your question, 
you want to calculate the correct Y position, given a  X position of the player. 
This is rather trivial. Have a look at this image:(45°_slpoes.png)

Assuming your slope-tile is at a given position x,y (origin is bottom left as in the image). 
You have the player position x1 and the width and the height of the sloped tile (u, v). 
x, y and x1 are world coordinates

Given these parameters, your players Y-position (y1) would be:

y1 = y + (x1 - x) * (v / u)

If you're only dealing with 45 degree angles, then it gets even simpler:

y1 = y + (x1 - x)

If the slope is the other way round, it's:

y1 = y + (v - (x1 - x))

there is also the formula: " y = mx + b "  Grade 9 algebra.

y = mx + b, 

where y is the coordinate calculated, 
m is the slope (-1 for down at 45 degrees, 1 for up at 45 degrees), 
and b is the y-intercept -- the y-coordinate where x=0

This allows you slightly more flexibility; 
you can change m to calculate a different slope other than 45-degrees. 
For example, an m of pi/3 gives you a slope of 30 degrees.
