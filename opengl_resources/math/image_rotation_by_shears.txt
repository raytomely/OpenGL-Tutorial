Want to see some magic?:
=======================

Do you still use Microsoft Paint, 
or some other under-powered paint package that 
does not allow you to rotate an image by an arbitrary angle? 
Ever been frustrated by this?


The (built in) rotation option only allows you to rotate the image in multiples of 90°
Those are the easy options to code.
What if you wanted to rotate your image by, say, 27°?


Well, thankfully, Microsoft equipped paintbrush with a couple of useful functions, 
these are resize and shear (which they call skew)

We can apply the three stage shear principle/concept we have just learned. 
The two basic tools provided to us in the paint package enable us to produce an arbitray rotation!

(The math is modfied slightly because paint applies the actions to the selected region, not a centroid, 
but it's the same thing we are doing.)



Step #1 Horizontal Shear:
========================
Select the image you want to rotate. 
The image is going to be rotated around the center of the selection. 
Make sure you leave sufficient space around the image for expansion as we distort the image.

With the region selected, click on the Resize button on the Painbrush toolbar and enter
in the desired skew (in degrees) in the horizontal plane.

In the case, I've entered 27°



Step #2 Vertical Scale:
======================
Now we need to scale in the vertical plane. Without adjusting the selected region, 
click on the Resize button again.

NOTE - We only want to scale in the vertical plane,
so make sure to uncheck the box 'Maintain aspect ratio'

The exact value to enter into this box is based on a calculaton. 
You'll need to use the forumla below to get a scaling factor, and round it to the nearest number:

1 / ( cos(rotation) ^ 2 )

In my case, for 27° the answer is 1.2596, so I've rounded this to 126% percentage scaling.

(Make sure your calculator is set into Degrees and in Scientific mode.
Type in your rotation, hit the cos button, then x2 then 1/x button).



Step #3 Vertical Shear:
======================
This one is easy. Click the Resize button once more and skew the image a negative number of degrees in the vertical plane.



Step #4 Global Resize:
=====================
One last step. We need to shrink the image back to the correct size.

To calculate the scaling factor we need to take the cos of the rotation angle.

For 27°, cos(27) = 0.8910 so we use this as the scale factor (rounded to 89%).

NOTE - This time make sure the 'Maintain aspect ratio' box is checked, 
as we need to apply this to both axis.


And we're done …
