Rotation along X:
y' = y*cos(a) - z*sin(a)
z' = y*sin(a) + z*cos(a)
x' = x

Rotation along Y:
z' = z*cos(a) - x*sin(a)
x' = z*sin(a) + x*cos(a)
y' = y

Rotation along Z:
x' = x*cos(a) - y*sin(a)
y' = x*sin(a) + y*cos(a)
z' = z


3D Perspective Projection
x' = x * fov / (z + viewer_distance) + half_screen_width
y' = -y * fov / (z + viewer_distance) + half_screen_height
z' -> for now, z is useless
